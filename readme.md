Comparing Linear Regression with kNN, Decision Tree and Random Forest with Bayesian Inference to Predict Wine Quality in Python.

We use python and Jupyter Notebook to download, extract, transform and analyze data about the physicochemical properties which make up wine, and use them to predict quality.  

wine_quality.db is the database file which can be recreated with the wine_quality.sql scheme by running the wine_quality_ETL.py script.  

Use the "Wine Quality.ipynd" to see the indepth analysis yourself.  

Wine_Quality-Presentation.tex contains the code for the presentation, made in LaTeX.  

models.py contains the the linear regression models which we use for our analysis.
